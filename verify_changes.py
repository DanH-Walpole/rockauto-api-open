Changes made:
1. Added price extraction to fallback part search logic
   - Looks for price in container or parent row
   - Uses same approach as primary extraction logic
   
2. Added 'price' field to returned object in fallback extraction logic
   
3. Updated test mock response to include price field with value "$181.79"
   
4. Added assertion to test to verify price field exists

These changes should ensure the price is always included in the search results,
which addresses the issue where price was not being returned.
